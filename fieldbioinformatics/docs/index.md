`artic` is a pipeline and set of accompanying tools for working with viral nanopore sequencing data, generated from tiling amplicon schemes.

Features include:

- read filtering
- primer trimming
- amplicon coverage normalisation
- variant calling
- consensus building

`artic` is designed to help run the artic bioinformatics protocols; for example the [SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus protocol](https://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html).

Use the navigation dropdowns on the left to read more about the pipeline, it's installation and getting started.
